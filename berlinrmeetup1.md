## Introduction to the meetup

---

Data scientists are not (only) statisticians
--

- **Culture and organization** : links with software engineering (version control, agile, high quality code)
- **Tool mediated advances** : algorithms closely linked to developments in hardware (GPUs) make whole new classes of problems tractable
- **Data science in the wild** : the cloud, the docker revolution and devops (you build it, you run it)
- **Visualization** : Javascript libraries and ever increasing expectations about quality and interactivity of visualizations
- **Powerful conceptual frameworks** : Auto diff, gradient descent (TF, PyTorch), causal graphs (Judea Pearl), Bayesian everything

---

Objectives of BerlinR
---

- Exploring **modern data science** from the R ecosystem (and explore surroundings.. JS ? Stan ? Keras ? API building ?)
- **Learning new concepts** and skills that unlock important, interesting or beautiful aspects of data science in R
- Covering **full stack data science** in R - from statistics to deep learning in production and everything in between
- Exploring interesting use cases and **domain specific challenges**

---

Principles of BerlinR
---

- **Welcoming** : there are no stupid questions, there is always help available
- **Uncool** : make hard things easy, don't create inaccessible cliques around certain skillsets
- **Curious** : learn everything, become better at everything, explore application domains
- **Useful** : every talk should have 
	- clear conceptual takeaways 
	- reusable code
- **Collaborative** : Pitch in to give talks, do side projects, contribute to the R community

Please volunteer your suggestions and comments :)
